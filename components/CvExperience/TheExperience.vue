        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          Working with <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/" target="_blank">FHIR API</a> requires a deep dive into the extremely sophisticated domain of
          Healthcare data management.
          However, that was worth it because FHIR is a great architectural example of a good organization of complex real data structures.

          Also, it was my first serious experience of fully remote work with a team distributed in six different time zones from West Coast (UTC-8) to
          Singapore (UTC+8).

          and took an active part in its growth and development, forming a great front-end team from scratch.
          It was an exceptional experience performing many roles and quickly switching between them and tasks,
          often outside the front-end of development.

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          Making SPA with functionality of GarageBand was an ambiguous challenge that required strong JavaScript skills, profound knowledge of digital
          signal processing and Web Audio API.
          I faced many nontrivial tasks on the way such as multitrack sound mixing, adding audio effects, audio latency detection, sound pitch
          detection with the use of Fourier analysis and autocorrelation, and so on. The solution of these issues required good math skills, rational
          usage of design patterns and understanding of sound nature.
          Eventually, I am proud of having taken part in creating one of the best web-based audio workstations of today.

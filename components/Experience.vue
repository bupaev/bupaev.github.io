          BandLab is a Singapore based social music creation platform, the
          combination of social network, multitrack audio workstation and
          VCS-like music storage. It is available on Web, iOS and Android OS.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Used Skills:</strong>
        Whole my workflow stack and especially Vanilla JS ES5/ES6, AngularJS 1.x,
        HTML5, SASS, Canvas, SVG, Web Audio API, WebWorkers, IndexedDB, Local
        Storage, Emscripten, WebRTC.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Role overview: </strong>
        Developing a browser-based multitrack digital audio workstation with
        AngularJS 1.x.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interesting challenges: </strong>
        Making SPA with functionality of GarageBand is an ambiguous challenge that
        requires strong JavaScript skills, profound knowledge of digital signal
        processing and Web Audio API.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve faced many nontrivial tasks on this way such as multitrack sound
        mixing, audio effects, audio latency detection, sound pitch detection with
        the use of Fourier analysis and autocorrelation, and so on. The solution of
        these issues requires good math skills, rational usage of design patterns
        and understanding of sound nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I’m proud to take part in making one of the best web-based
        audio workstation of today.

          Working with <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/" target="_blank">FHIR API</a> requires a deep dive into the extremely sophisticated domain of
          Healthcare data management.
          However that was worth it because FHIR is a great architectural example of a good organization of complex real data structures.

        This position gave me a lot of new professional experience. I joined the team at an early stage of its formation
        and took an active part in its growth and development, forming a great front-end team from scratch.
        It was an exceptional experience working in many roles and quickly switching between roles and tasks,
        often outside the front-end of development.

      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        Making SPA with functionality of GarageBand is an ambiguous challenge that required strong JavaScript skills,
        profound knowledge of digital signal processing and Web Audio API. I faced many nontrivial tasks on the way
        such as multitrack sound mixing, adding audio effects, audio latency detection, sound pitch detection
        with the use of Fourier analysis and autocorrelation, and so on. The solution of these issues required good math skills,
        rational usage of design patterns and understanding of sound nature. Eventually, I’m proud to take part in making one of
        the best web-based audio workstation of today.
